    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00449-013-1055-7
    The luminescence (lux) operon (luxICDABEG) of Vibrio fischeri is regulated by the transcriptional activator LuxR
    and 3OC6HSL [9, 10]. In this system, LuxI synthase enzymatically produces 3OC6HSL, which can diffuse across the
    cell membrane and act as a communication signal to mediate intercellular coupling. It binds to the regulator LuxR,
    and the LuxR–AHL complex undergoes a conformational change to form a transcriptional activator suitable for the
    luxI promoter binding to initiate gene expression.

    Schemi carini per far capire meccanismo ad alto livello
    The producer cells (Fig.3) synthesize lactone via the LuxI enzyme. This enzyme is regulated by the pBad promoter,
    which is induced by arabinose but repressed by glucose. This means that the production of lactone can be controlled
    in two ways, increasing the production with arabinose and decreasing it with glucose.
    The sensor cells (Fig.4) produce sfGFP when a large enough concentration of lactone is present in the medium.
    In this case, the cell constitutively produces LuxR, which binds to the lactone present in the medium and together,
    they form a complex that activates the pLux promoter, generating the sfGFP whose fluorescence can be detected.

    Synthase: LuxI
    Action: Binds to the LuxR gene product of the Lux operon. The resulting complex can bind to the lux box and modulate
    transcription from the lux promoters.

    *** ESEMPIO DI SINCRONIZZAZIONE: Synchronization of genetic oscillations by communication-based circuits.
    (A) A QS-based gene circuit that synchronizes the oscillation of gene expression in an isogenic bacterial population.
    The oscillation is enabled by positive feedback, arising from the self-activation of AHL synthesis, and negative
    feedback, mediated by...
    ...an additional positive feedback loop is introduced by coupling the production of thermally unstable H2O2 by NADH
    dehydrogenase (ndh) with AHL biosynthesis, leading to global oscillation synchronization of millions of cells.

    Figure 1. LuxR is the intracellular receptor for the autoinducer 3OC6HSL, produced by LuxI. LuxR interacts with 3OC6HSL
    to form a dimeric transcriptional activator complex that binds the lux box site, which controls expression of the
    lux operon, luxICDABEG. The lux operon controls synthesis of the bacterial luciferase and its substrate, which are
    responsible for bioluminescence.
    ...
    LitR also activates luxR, which encodes the intracellular receptor LuxR of the LuxI/R branch of the system. LuxI/R
    controls expression of the lux operon, luxICDABEG, by synthesizing (via LuxI) and detecting (via LuxR) the
    autoinducer N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL). The lux operon is responsible for both 3OC6HSL
    production (LuxI) and bioluminescence (LuxCDABEG)
    ...
    Possiamo ipotizzare che LuxR sia espresso costitutivamente, tagliando via la catena sinistra di Fig. 1 che porta a
    produrre LitR che induce LuxR.
    Qua però sembra di nuovo che LuxR sia capace di indurre l'espressione di Lux1. O forse le frecce sono più generiche?

    Seconda figura. AHLs are synthesized by LuxI from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and fatty acid precursors conjugated
    to an acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP). AHLs can freely diffuse across the cell wall and membrane. The cytoplasmic
    receptor protein, LuxR, forms a multimer after binding to the AHL, which interacts with one or more lux boxes
    upstream from the regulated target gene. RNA polymerase interacts to stimulate transcription of the operon.

    Quorum sensing (QS) is a process of cell–cell communication for bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella that cause
    foodborne diseases, with the production, release, and detection of autoinducer (AI) molecules that participate in

17. S-Adenosyl methionine
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Adenosyl_methionine
    S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM), also known under the commercial names of SAMe, SAM-e, or AdoMet, is a common
    cosubstrate involved in methyl group transfers, transsulfuration, and aminopropylation. Although these anabolic
    reactions occur throughout the body, most SAM is produced and consumed in the liver.
    ...
    In bacteria, SAM is bound by the SAM riboswitch, which regulates genes involved in methionine or cysteine
    biosynthesis. In eukaryotic cells, SAM serves as a regulator of a variety of processes including DNA, tRNA, and
    rRNA methylation; immune response;[2] amino acid metabolism; transsulfuration; and more.
